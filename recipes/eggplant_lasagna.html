      </ul>
       <h3>One Batch Arugula Pesto</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>1 large garlic clove</li>
          <li>1/4 cup toasted almonds, smoked almonds, or pinenuts</li>
          <li>1/2 cup packed basil leaves</li>
          <li>1 cup packed arugula</li>
          <li>1 tsp lemon zest</li>
          <li>1 Tbsp fresh lemon juice</li>
          <li>1/3-1/2 cup light flavored olive oil (not bitter)</li>
          <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
          <li>1/4 tsp cracked pepper</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
     <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 400 F</li>
      <li>Sweat and ROAST EGGPLANT: Slice eggplant into 1/2-inch thick slices and place on two parchment-lined sheet pans. Sprinkle half the salt over the top as evenly as possible. Turn each piece over and sprinkle the remaining salt. Let the eggplant sit (and sweat) 15-20 minutes while the oven gets hot. When the eggplants look damp, pat the top side down with paper towels. Brush or spray with olive oil. Flip them. Blot with paper towels, spray with olive oil. Roast in the middle of the oven for 30-40 minutes, checking at 25 minutes. Roast until golden and tender. Thinner slices will cook faster, thicker slower.</li>
      <li>SPINACH FILLING: While the eggplant roasts, make the filling. In a large skillet, saute the onion, over medium heat until. tender about 5-7 minutes. Add the garlic and saute until fragrant. Add the fresh spinach, lowering heat, gently wilting. Season with salt and pepper, chili flakes, turn heat off.</li>
      <li>RICOTTA MIXTURE: In a medium bowl, whisk with a fork, the ricotta, egg, nutmeg, basil and salt. Set aside.</li>
      <li>ASSEMBLE: Spray or brush a 9×13 baking dish (or 12-inch round baking dish) with olive oil. Place 3/4 cup marina sauce on the bottom, or enough to cover the bottom. Place 1/2 of the no-boil lasagna noodles over top. Spread another thin layer of marinara over the pasta or just enough to lightly coat. Add half the roasted eggplant, overlapping a little if need be. Dot with half of the ricotta mixture. Spoon all of the wilted spinach mixture over the top evenly. Sprinkle with 1/2- 3/4 cup mozzarella and 1/8 cup pecorino. Add 2nd layer of pasta sheets. Lightly cover with 3/4 cup marinara (you’ll need one more layer of marinara for the top, so if it looks like you could run out, water this down a bit here.) Next add the remaining eggplant, overlapping if need be. Smother with the remaining marinara sauce and spoon the remaining ricotta in fluffy dollops over the top. Sprinkle with a few chili flakes,  1/2 cup mozzarella cheese and 1/8 pecorino.</li>
      <li>BAKE: Cover with foil (if your lasagna comes to the top edge of the baking dish, cover with parchment first and then with foil) and bake in a 375 F oven for 45-50 minutes, uncover and bake 10-20 more minutes, until golden and bubbling.</li>
      <li>While it is baking make the Arugula Pesto – place everything in food processor and pulse until combined, but not too smooth. Add more oil, to make it looser if you like, or less to make it thicker.</li>
      <li>The lasagna is done when it is golden, bubbling and slightly puffed in the center. Let it rest 5 minutes before serving, dot it with  Arugula pesto or serve it on the side.</li>
     </ol>
